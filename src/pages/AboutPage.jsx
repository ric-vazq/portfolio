        <p className="">
          I am a young professional living and working in Berlin, Germany.
          Originally from Puerto Rico, I presently work as an intermediate care
          nurse for the Charit√©. My experience in a hospital setting has
          developed strong interdisciplinary communication, self-reflection, and
          organisational skills.
        </p>
        <p className="">
          Parallel to my work as a nurse I took part in a Full Stack Web
          Developer Bootcamp. During that time I found a new passion in coding.
          The constant learning, growth, and creativity have made it an
          attractive field for me. As such, I will be partaking in a AI & Python
          Course from May until July to broaden my skillset. Nevertheless, I am
          actively looking for work as a junior Full-Stack Developer. Interested
          recruiters may access my resume{" "}
          <span className="link text-primary" onClick={toResume}>
            here
          </span>{" "}
          or through the navigation bar.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a more personal note, I am an avid gym-goer, yogi, and swimmer. I
          enjoy subjects such as relational psychology, etymology, different
          sciences, and health in all its distinct forms.{" "}
